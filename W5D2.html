  Before starting please check if you have npm installed on your computer by typing in your terminal: <pre>npm -v</pre>

  If it provides a version number such as 3.8.9: Install nodemon by pasting in your terminal: <pre>npm install -g nodemon</pre>

  If it says 'npm: command not found' then paste the following three lines in your console: <pre>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"<br>brew install node <br>npm install -g nodemon</pre>

  4:00 Warm-up (If you have not reached for loops continue codecademy) <br>
  <b>First person to complete the bonus I will bring a donut on Tuesday :)</b> <br>
  On <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a> create a function which prints only the even numbers between 1 and 100 <br>
  Bonus: Make the function take an argument so that your function will print the even numbers between 1 and any number provided. <br><br>
  
  4:30 <b>Game Builders:</b> I want you to download this <a href="https://giselakay.github.io/MBSpring17/phaser_tutorial_02.zip">zip</a>. It's up to you whether you go through the tutorial (tutorial.html) or just look at the final source code (part9.html). Try to understand as much of the code as possible though. 

  <br>By the end you should understand how to:<ul>
  <li>Load images in your game</li>
  <li>Add gravity to your game</li>
  <li>Create groups (can be used for enemies, bones, or bobbleheads ;))</li>
  <li>Check for collision</li>
  </ul><br>

  4:30 <b>Web App Ppls:</b>
  (We'll talk about whose which roles in a bit)

  <br> Front-End developers: 
   Download this <a href="https://giselakay.github.io/MBSpring17/frontEndStarterFile.html">file</a> and start playing with html to design your application. (I would suggest a team member draw out on paper what the website will look like and all agree as a team before beginning programming.) Also look into <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/"> Bootstrap </a> to easily design lists, buttons, etc. <br>

  <br> Back-End developers:
  Talk to Elias. He'll teach you stuff!
<!--   4:30 Github</li>
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/"> Create a Github repository</a> for your project. Github will be where all of your code from each team member is stored. </li> -->
